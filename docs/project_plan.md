# Task Management System - Project Plan

## Project Overview
The Task Management System is a serverless application designed for field teams, allowing administrators to create and assign tasks to team members. Team members can view and update their assigned tasks, while administrators have oversight of all tasks, team assignments, and deadlines. The system includes features for task notifications, status updates, and deadline tracking.

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Backend**: Flask REST API (Python 3.12.x)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS Serverless services deployed using AWS SAM

### AWS Services
1. **AWS Lambda**: For running the Flask API backend
2. **Amazon API Gateway**: To expose the REST API endpoints
3. **Amazon DynamoDB**: For storing task, user, and team data
4. **Amazon Cognito**: For user authentication and authorization
5. **Amazon S3**: For hosting the static frontend files
6. **Amazon CloudFront**: For content delivery of frontend assets
7. **AWS EventBridge**: For scheduling deadline notifications
8. **Amazon SNS/SES**: For sending notifications to users
9. **AWS CloudWatch**: For monitoring and logging
10. **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**: For configuration management

## System Components

### 1. User Management
- User registration and authentication
- Role-based access control (Admin vs. Team Member)
- User profile management

### 2. Task Management
- Task creation with details (title, description, priority, deadline)
- Task assignment to team members
- Task status updates (New, In Progress, Completed, Overdue)
- Task filtering and sorting capabilities

### 3. Notification System
- Deadline reminders
- Task assignment notifications
- Status update notifications
- Daily/weekly task summaries

### 4. Admin Dashboard
- Overview of all tasks and their statuses
- Team performance metrics
- Deadline tracking
- Resource allocation view

### 5. Team Member Interface
